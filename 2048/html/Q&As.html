                <p>2k48 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game.
                    The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a
                    4x4 grid combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
                    The game is won when a 2048 tile is created, although
                    players can continue playing to reach higher numbers.</p>
